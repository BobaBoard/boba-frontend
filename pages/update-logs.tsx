                        We're officially in a glorious and radiant future in
                        which our sidemenu is actually decent. Thank you for
                        putting up with my previous "hastily-thrown together"
                        one for so long.

                        <strong>Board pinning!</strong> See that empty space on
                        the left of your shiny new menu? Pinned boards go there.
                        You can find the option in the boards' sidebar dropdown.

                        <strong>Server Side Rendering</strong> I've begun taking
                        the first step into pre-rendering pages on the server.
                        What this will mean in the future is improved loading
                        times for all of us (plus some cool bonuses you'll learn
                        about with time). But what this means for now is that
                        you won't see the board color flash from pink to the
                        actual one on first load ever again.

                        <strong>Server Cache</strong> I'm now caching the
                        results of some database queries, which means I won't
                        recalculate them every single time. This should lead,
                        with time, to better and better load times. And also,
                        very likely, to a bunch of bugs along the way (caching
                        is hard).

                        Editor spacing has been improved again. It's a bit
                        workaround-y in that I'm trying to simulate "line break"
                        on one new line, "paragraph break" on two consecutive
                        new lines without that being supported by our editor.

                        description on mobile, changed look of login text
                        fields, avatars "cutouts" are now actually transparent,
                        and I added some extra padding at the bottom of threads
                        so the "new comment" button won't overlap the reply one.

                        Category filtering now works on boards. It's not
                        automatic, as the board tags need to be added by the
                        editor. You'll soon see an example in !bobaland.

                        hopefully.......

                    (And if you're wondering, "can I change the default view of
                    older threads/add tags?", the answer is: soon, I swear.)

                    Most of you won't be directly influenced by these updates,
                    but we've just unlocked our first batch of admin tools, and
                    introduced the concept of Roles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What are Roles? Well, like on Discord, Roles can be assigned
                    to users, and each of them can have a bunch of associated
                    permissions. This means that, instead of dividing people in
                    "moderators/admins" and "everyone else", we can create as
                    many fine-grained roles as we want, filling many different
                    purposes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Right now there's only two permissions: edit sidebar (yes,
                    we're finally going to get sidebar descriptions), and "post
                    as role". What does post as role do? Head to !bobaland to
                    find out.

                      <li>
                        You can now dismiss notifications for a single board.

                    A bigger update shall come in the following days (once the
                    first contracted job comes in ü§û), but in the meantime enjoy
                    a bunch of well-deserved bug fixes:

                      <li>
                        <strong>Added more formatting options for text</strong>.
                        Just go see. (Also links are pink now).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        More things can be clicked open in another tab:
                        everything in the top header bar, thread links, pages in
                        the login menu... Let me know if I forgot something!
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Tags should now go to the next line.... better. No more
                        splitting in the middle of the word unless necessary.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The flickering sidemenu on the new version of iOS has
                        been fixed. The evil has temporarily been defeated once
                        again.

                    Fixed the * button (I hope), testing a new method to get

                    Today's update is huge. I've completely reworked the logic
                    for displaying threads so it's not a crime against
                    programming (as much), and added two view modes:{" "}
                    <b>gallery</b> and <b>timeline</b>. In gallery mode, you can
                    also use post categories to filter what you see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These modes are currently only available on larger screens
                    (mobile is pending on me figuring out where to put the
                    buttons). If all goes well, you'll soon be able to choose
                    the default view mode when creating a new thread.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this doesn't defeat the Arcana thread yet, it's a step
                    forward. Feedback & thoughts welcome (so hit that report
                    button) (there's no report button) (use the usual avenues).

                      jumping around as the embeds load. This is a bit

                      marked as link.

                      within the context of a board or of a thread. Want to add
                      a +Luigi category to your "fictional husbands" shrine

                      yellow color that makes them more visible, I plan to have
                      a couple features around them in the future, like showing
                      them at the top of the post instead, or making sure

                      Beam me up, Scotty! You can now click on the thread balls
                      to go back up and answer more quickly. This update gave me
                      the impression of causing degraded performance on thread
                      rendering, which I didn't have time to investigate fully.
                      I'll do more testing in the next days.

                      Updated tags logic in preparation for indexed tags. If you
                      notice problems, you know where to go.

                  [7/10/20] Updates section goes down... updates section goes
                  up... (What I mean is, click on that arrow at the bottom to
                  expand)
                  <br />I hope with this update to have solved all our
                  notification woes. Please do let me know if notification or
                  "new comment/post" indicators don't act as you'd naturally
                  expect.

                  [7/09/20] Sorry for the intermittent troubles today! A bunch
                  of backend updates you won't even notice and... small
                  experimental update on displaying read replies with a more
                  subdued style. Onwards with better thread management!

                  [7/04/20] A lot of performance updates. And... did someone
                  mention "opening BOARDS in a new tab"?

                  [7/03/20] Yesterday's update broke everything. This is take 2.

                  [7/02/20] I've attempted some performance optimization. I
                  don't know if you'll see any difference in speed, but do
                  report if things break. I might push more performance updates
                  throughout the week so keep an eye out for weirdness!

                  [7/01/20] It's tags time!!! They do nothing, really. But you
                  can chat in them! #what a userful feature #you're all welcome
