                  <p>
                    Might add more updates later today, but for now:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Added default view mode selection. Want to make a
                        Gallery? A timeline? You can now choose! Of course, the
                        other modes aren't as battle-tested as thread. Try them
                        out, and leave feedback (in the login menu)!
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Category filtering now works on boards. It's not
                        automatic, as the board tags need to be added by the
                        editor. You'll soon see an example in !bobaland.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Bunch of CSS fixes, including the tags indentation
                        and... the iOS sidemenu flicker.... again.....
                        hopefully.......
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    (And if you're wondering, "can I change the default view of
                    older threads/add tags?", the answer is: soon, I swear.)

                    Most of you won't be directly influenced by these updates,
                    but we've just unlocked our first batch of admin tools, and
                    introduced the concept of Roles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What are Roles? Well, like on Discord, Roles can be assigned
                    to users, and each of them can have a bunch of associated
                    permissions. This means that, instead of dividing people in
                    "moderators/admins" and "everyone else", we can create as
                    many fine-grained roles as we want, filling many different
                    purposes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Right now there's only two permissions: edit sidebar (yes,
                    we're finally going to get sidebar descriptions), and "post
                    as role". What does post as role do? Head to !bobaland to
                    find out.

                    It's time for two highly-requested features to make their
                    debut:
                    <ul>
                      <li>You can now mute boards.</li>
                      <li>
                        You can now dismiss notifications for a single board.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    What else there is to say? You're welcome. <br />

                      (Oh, right! The login menu has an anonymous feedback form

                    A bigger update shall come in the following days (once the
                    first contracted job comes in ðŸ¤ž), but in the meantime enjoy
                    a bunch of well-deserved bug fixes:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Added more formatting options for text</strong>.
                        Just go see. (Also links are pink now).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        More things can be clicked open in another tab:
                        everything in the top header bar, thread links, pages in
                        the login menu... Let me know if I forgot something!
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Tags should now go to the next line.... better. No more
                        splitting in the middle of the word unless necessary.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The flickering sidemenu on the new version of iOS has
                        been fixed. The evil has temporarily been defeated once
                        again.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    Still technically on hiatus and working on the volunteers
                    onboarding, but I couldn't see you all suffer like this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fixed the * button (I hope), testing a new method to get
                    around Big Orange, and adding some fixes I had made for the
                    TTTE gallery preview back into the main website.

                  <p>
                    Today's update is huge. I've completely reworked the logic
                    for displaying threads so it's not a crime against
                    programming (as much), and added two view modes:{" "}
                    <b>gallery</b> and <b>timeline</b>. In gallery mode, you can
                    also use post categories to filter what you see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These modes are currently only available on larger screens
                    (mobile is pending on me figuring out where to put the
                    buttons). If all goes well, you'll soon be able to choose
                    the default view mode when creating a new thread.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While this doesn't defeat the Arcana thread yet, it's a step
                    forward. Feedback & thoughts welcome (so hit that report
                    button) (there's no report button) (use the usual avenues).

                      [Embeds Size Saving]: We're now saving the size of the
                      embeds, so you shouldn't see (for new posts) as much
                      jumping around as the embeds load. This is a bit
                      experimental. Cross your fingers.

                    <li>
                      [Removing Extra White Lines]: Extra white lines at the end

                    <li>
                      [Bug Fix 1]: Fixed bug with link auto-highlighting, where
                      a simple www would result in the following word being
                      marked as link.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      [Bug Fix 4]: re-enable copy paste that was broken in some
                      iOS versions, and re-enabled the pasting of images, which
                      was broken in other browsers.

                      [Category Tags]: you can prefix tags with + to turn them
                      into category tags. Category tags will be searchable only
                      within the context of a board or of a thread. Want to add
                      a +Luigi category to your "fictional husbands" shrine
                      without having every single post show up in search? Now
                      you can.

                    <li>
                      [Content Warning Tags]: you can prefix tags with "cw:" to
                      turn them into content warning tags. Other than a swanky
                      yellow color that makes them more visible, I plan to have
                      a couple features around them in the future, like showing
                      them at the top of the post instead, or making sure
                      synonyms are taken into account when deny-listing them.

                    <li>
                      Changed spacing of comments. Longer comments should be

                  [8/02/2020] Completely changed the underlying HTML/CSS layout
                  structure. You will see a bunch of improvements all around
                  (e.g. address bar on mobile should disappear, scroll position
                  on page change should work way better).

                  [7/23/20] The constant reload of embeds at inappropriate times
                  should be fixed once and for all. Forgive me for the trouble,
                  I had angered the programming gods by being, well, an idiot.

                  [7/22/20] Try the small experimental new button on threads
                  that will cycle you through all the new contribution. UX has a
                  lot to improve, but I wanted to give it to you as soon as
                  possible!

                  [7/21/20] Exactly 20 days after tags first appeared... we have
                  indexable tags! Simply type ! at the beginning of a tag to
                  make it searchable at some point in the future. Yeah, I mean,
                  I said we had indexable tags, not USEFUL indexable tags.

                  [7/19/20] [PLEASE READ] A bunch of "crossing fingers I don't
                  murder the whole website" updates:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      I added the top-right dropdown on board threads again. If
                      any of you gets flickering again, let me know so you can
                      help me get at the bottom of it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The library I'm using for query caching has a bug, and I
                      solved it by re-implementing "load next board page" from
                      scratch. Hopefully this fixes duplicates posts and doesn't
                      break anything new.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Beam me up, Scotty! You can now click on the thread balls
                      to go back up and answer more quickly. This update gave me
                      the impression of causing degraded performance on thread
                      rendering, which I didn't have time to investigate fully.
                      I'll do more testing in the next days.

                      Updated tags logic in preparation for indexed tags. If you
                      notice problems, you know where to go.

                  [7/10/20] Updates section goes down... updates section goes
                  up... (What I mean is, click on that arrow at the bottom to
                  expand)
                  <br />I hope with this update to have solved all our
                  notification woes. Please do let me know if notification or
                  "new comment/post" indicators don't act as you'd naturally
                  expect.

                  [7/09/20] Sorry for the intermittent troubles today! A bunch
                  of backend updates you won't even notice and... small
                  experimental update on displaying read replies with a more
                  subdued style. Onwards with better thread management!

                <li>
                  [7/04/20] A lot of performance updates. And... did someone
                  mention "opening BOARDS in a new tab"?

                  [7/03/20] Yesterday's update broke everything. This is take 2.

                <li>
                  [7/02/20] I've attempted some performance optimization. I
                  don't know if you'll see any difference in speed, but do
                  report if things break. I might push more performance updates
                  throughout the week so keep an eye out for weirdness!

                  [7/01/20] It's tags time!!! They do nothing, really. But you
                  can chat in them! #what a userful feature #you're all welcome
