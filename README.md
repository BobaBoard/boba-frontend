## BobaBoard

BobaBoard is a modern, open source community-building software that draws
inspiration from old-school forums for functionality and from modern social
media for its style of interaction. It prioritizes privacy and fluidity of
identity for users within communities and allows high levels of customization
and fine-grained permission settings for users, community managers, and instance
owners. The unique UX encourages creative expression across different formats,
styles of communication, and community building.

You can find out more about BobaBoard in general on our
[website](https://www.bobaboard.com) and as a project by visiting our
[project guide](https://docs.bobaboard.com/docs/project/intro).
